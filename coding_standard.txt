As we have different systems, to avoid further complexity, I propose some coding standards here.

1. All urls should be lower case. If necessary, use '-' to connect words and '_' to connect siblings.
    e.g. localhost/profile/shef/shef_a101

2. All paths use os lib to join. e.g. TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')

3. All class names capitalize the first letter of words. e.g. class TestModel(models.Model)

4. All function names and variable names are lower case. If necessary, use '_' to connect words. 
    e.g. def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields)

5. Django structure: 
    recipeApp is the main app (currently), it's mainly function is to route to the other apps. 
    Each app has a model.py to store relavent models/tables (currently all models in userAccount which is not good). 
    Each app has urls.py to route to its sibling urls, don't create duplicate urls that route to the same page.
    Each app has views.py to define the exact pages to be routed.
    Each app has templates folder to store relavent html pages.
    The base dir has a general templates folder to store html pages that probably used in multiple apps. e.g. welcome page
    The base dir has a general statics folder to store css, js, images that probably used in multiple apps. e.g. bootstrap extension

If any confusion and don't have time to discuss, follow the standards shown on helloWorld.
